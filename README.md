# About
Originally the [8-Queens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) problem designed in the mid 1800's, this notebook tackles the slightly more complicated n-Queens problem. Here, a `n x n` board is placed with `n` queens in such a way that no queens can attack each other. In an attempt to solve this using evolutionary algorithms and genetic programming, the Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python (DEAP) is utilized to find a possible solution.
